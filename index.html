		<p>I am currently pursuing PhD in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.gmu.edu" target="_blank">George Mason University</a> where I also work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant. My primary interests lie in the field of machine learning and computer vision. I graduated with a degree in computer engineering from <a href="http://pcampus.edu.np" target="_blank">Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus in Nepal</a>. In the recent past, I have worked closely with UNICEF Nepal and local partners on projects that include efficient information dissemination and data collection based on mobile technologies, automated interactive surveys, and data analytics and visualization. I was also an AI Fellow at <a href="https://fusemachines.com.np" target="_blank">Fusemachines Nepal</a> where I played with and worked on machine learning projects.
		<p>In my free time, I love to explore ideas and topics in mathematics, physics, astronomy, nature of mind and consciousness, philosophy, and evolutionary biology among others. I find the universe thrillingly fascinating, and the fact that we are an insignificant part of the cosmos, inspires me look up in the sky at night.
		<p>I have always wanted to maintain a habit of writing regularly, and that was the initial motivation for maintaining a blog. But, to my despair, my blog has turned into a long abandoned haunted space. I hope that, someday, I will gather a little courage and resurrect my blog.</p>
		<p>Anyway, drop by on <a href="https://twitter.com/abpaudel" target="_blank">Twitter</a> if you want to say <i>hello</i>.</p>
