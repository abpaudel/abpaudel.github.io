		<p>I am a computer engineering graduate from <a href="http://pcampus.edu.np/" target="_blank">Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus</a>. I am currently working on projects for UNICEF Nepal that include efficient information dissemination and data collection based on mobile technologies, automated interactive surveys, and data analysis and visualization. My primary interests lie in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am also involved in teaching introductory course on machine learning at <a href="https://mpercept.academy/" target="_blank">MPercept Academy</a>, where I enjoy sharing things I have learnt.</p>
		<p>In my free time, I love to explore ideas and topics in mathematics, physics, astronomy, nature of mind and consciousness, philosophy, and evolutionary biology among others. I find the universe thrillingly fascinating, and the fact that we are an insignificant part of the cosmos, inspires me look up in the sky at night. Occasionally, I love to capture <a href="https://www.instagram.com/{{site.instagram}}" target="_blank">pictures</a>, and my phone has been a good friend of mine to help explore that endeavor. I also acquired skills of playing bamboo flute after my high school, and can play somewhat <a href="https://youtu.be/rg9m323oo6s" target="_blank">decent melodies</a>.</p>
		<p>I have always wanted to maintain a habit of writing regularly, and that was the initial motivation for maintaining a blog. But, to my despair, my blog has turned into a long abandoned haunted space. I hope that, someday, I will gather a little courage and resurrect my blog.</p>
		<p>Anyway, drop by on <a href="https://twitter.com/{{site.twitter}}" target="_blank">Twitter</a> if you want to say <i>hello</i>.</p>
