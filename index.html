		<p>I am a computer engineering graduate from Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus. I am currently working on mobile based technologies for efficient data collection and real-time analytics for UNICEF Nepal. My primary interests lie in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am also an AI Fellow at Fusemachines Nepal.</p>
		<p>In my free time, I love to explore mathematics, physics, astronomy, nature of mind and consciousness, philosophy, and evolutionary biology among others. The universe fascinates me, and the fact that we are an insignificant part of the cosmos, inspires me look up in the sky at night. Occasionally, I love to capture pictures, and fulfill this desire with my phone. I also acquired skills of playing bamboo flute after my high school, and can play somewhat decent melodies.</p>
		<p>I have always wanted to maintain a habit of writing regularly, and that was the initial motivation for maintaining a blog. But, to my despair, my blog has turned into a long abandoned haunted space. I hope that, someday, I will gather some courage and resurrect my blog.</p>
